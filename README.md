# Networking-Project-Using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer

I was learning Networking and Cyber Security at Plymouth University using Cisco Packet Tracer. I was attempting to build a hierarchial network for it's redundancy and segmented network for good cyber security practices. However, I had to settle with this which is a type of collapsed core hierarchial network. My theoretical knowledge is good but my implimentation could be improved. Still a fun project I had to complete.
